			<h2>教員(Supervisor)</h2>
      		<p>KUN LI, PH.D</p>
			<p>Kun Li(李鯤) received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2011, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan, in 2014 and 2017, respectively.
			From 2017 to 2019, he was a Researcher with the Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan. 
			In 2020, he joined Kagawa University, Japan, where he currently works as Assistant Professor. 
			He is currently a Visiting Researcher with Electromagnetic Waves in Complex Media (eWAVES) research group, CNRS/IETR, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France. 
			His research interests include safety assessment of radio frequency radiation exposure to the human body and bio-EMC issues in microwave, millimeter and THz bands, over-the-air testing for mobile communication systems, low-profile wearable antenna and power divider design, diversity/adaptive/MIMO/UWB techniques for wireless body area network system.
			Dr. Li was the recipient of the Young Scientist Award of the URSI, in 2020, the Risaburo Sato Award of EMC Sapporo & AMPEC, in 2019, the IEEE Nagoya Section International Conference Presentation Awards, in 2016, the IEEE AP-S Japan Student Award in 2015, and the IEICE Best Letter Award in 2017. He was a Guest Associate Editor for Frontiers in Public Health Special Issue: Human Exposure to New-Emerging Electric, Magnetic and Electromagnetic Fields. 
			He has served as a Reviewer for multiple journal papers, such as IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT, Bioelectromagnetics, Frontiers in Public Health, Scientific Reports, Optics Express, IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation, and IEICE Transactions on Communications. 
			He is a member of IEEE International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety TC95 and Co-Chair of Working Group 7 under Subcommittee 6 EMF Dosimetry Modeling established to study average schemes and assessment methods of absorbed power density. 
			He is a senior member of URSI, and a member of IEEE and IEICE.</p>
